# What Is GIS?

In technology part, GIS is the abbreviation of **Geographic Information Systems**
Computer-based (hardware & software) system that:
- Create locationally referenced data
- Stores and organizes locationally referenced data
- Performs spatial analyses
- Creates visualizations, usually in map form (but also tables, graphs, dashboards)

In theory part, GIS is the abbreviation of **Geographic Information Science**
- Theory behind how to solve spatial problems and how to implement GISystems
- The study of the design, data, and methods of GISystems
- Computational techniques and data structures
- The use, representation, analysis, and ethics of geo-referenced data

GIS also is A combination of 
- The science of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering spatial data
- Tools and techniques such as land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, GIS, GPS, photogrammetry
- The social structures that enable the enactment of the science and tools
- The people enacting it all

# Functions of GIS
GIS can:
- identify and analyze nearby Locations
- Find Spatial Patterns
- Determine Change Over Time
- Collect and Organize Spatial Information
- Track and Share Real-Time Data
- Manage Emergency Response


# Fundamental concept & Keywords
1. Theory and Practice
   - Theory
     - A set of rules for understanding how something works
     - Tied to the work of science and scholarship; looking for patterns, equations, or rules for how the world works
   - Practice
     - Action towards a goal. The enactment of Theory
     - Tied to the work of technologists, explorers, tinkerers; doers rather than pure thinkers

2. Structure and Agency
   - Structure
     - The underlying set of rules for how a society works, especially, how it reproduces itself
     - A type of theory that emphasi zes the overarching rules of a society
   - Agency
     - The ability of the individual to exert choice of will within the social structure
     - Agent-based social theories emphasize activism, change
     - Agent-based modeling in GIS

3. Objectivity and Subjectivity
   - Objectivity
     - The idealized mental position for scientific study
     - The ability to objectively detect the world and analyze it, free from personal opinions and biases
   - Subjectivity
     - A set of beliefs that consciously (or unconsciously) affect one's thought processes and actions
     - The "myth of neutrality/objectivity" is undercut by scholars studying race and gender, who highlight the embeddedness and situatedness of all persons - our position in the world affects how we see the world
4. Ontology and Epistemology
   - Ontology
     - Philosophical definition: The study of the categories of existence and the relationships among them
     - In GIS: classifications and relationships between categories
     - Think of a filing cabinet and the selection of folders
   - Epistemology
     - Definition: the study of knowledge
     - How do we know what we know? What type of evidence do we accept?
     - What data helps decide what goes in each filing folder 

5. Nature and Society
   - Nature: Long viewed as places untouched by humanity; more holistically as the physical world, including humanity
   - Society: The organization of humanity in its many forms; traditionally seen as separate from / better than nature
   - Nature/Society Critiques
     - The idea of nature is socially produced;the physical world exits but there is no 'nature' aside from humans' varying ideas about the physical world
     - Human impacts are so widespread (climate change, pollution, land use) that no part of the Earth is unaffected by humanity
