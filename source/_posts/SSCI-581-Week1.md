- Create locationally referenced data
- Stores and organizes locationally referenced data
- Performs spatial analyses
- Creates visualizations, usually in map form (but also tables, graphs, dashboards)

In theory part, GIS is the abbreviation of **Geographic Information Science**
- Theory behind how to solve spatial problems and how to implement GISystems
- The study of the design, data, and methods of GISystems
- Computational techniques and data structures
- The use, representation, analysis, and ethics of geo-referenced data

GIS also is A combination of 
- The science of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering spatial data
- Tools and techniques such as land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, GIS, GPS, photogrammetry
- The social structures that enable the enactment of the science and tools
- The people enacting it all

# Functions of GIS
GIS can:
- identify and analyze nearby Locations
- Find Spatial Patterns
- Determine Change Over Time
- Collect and Organize Spatial Information
- Track and Share Real-Time Data
- Manage Emergency Response
